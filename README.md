This is Hans from Philadelphia, and I develop games, useful tools, and mobile apps. I'm working on projects using Java, Swift, Python, C++, R, and even Ocaml. Currently learning SQL and React Native, I hope to become a real data analyst and software engineer one day. You can check out my content at https://www.youtube.com/@hanszhu550/videos.
